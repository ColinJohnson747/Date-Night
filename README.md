# Welcome to the Date Night application

Have you ever asked your date what they wanted to eat and they respond back with the dreaded "I don't know, what do you want to eat?"? Or do you just want to surprise your date and show them are sophisticated and culturally diverse you are? Or do you want to add culturally diversity to your recipe book? This is the website for you!

# How it works
With this website, you can choose what cuisine type you want to cook, and what kind of alcohol you like, and this website will give you a culturally selected meal recipe, and an alcohol-related cocktail recipe. If you don't know what kind kind of cuisine you want, or if your date just won't select a cuisine, there is a random selection for you! Same thing with the alcohol! 

The website will give you a completed picture of what the meal and drink should look like, the ingredient list, and the instructions on how to make the meal! There is also a link to the original recipe page and occasionally, there's a video along with the recipes!
